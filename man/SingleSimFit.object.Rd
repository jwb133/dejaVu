\title{SingleSimFit object
 
A \code{SingleSimFit} object is returned from calling \code{Simfit} with
a \code{SingleSim object}. It can be used to both impute data sets or can be summarized}
\arguments{
\item{singleSim}{The \code{SingleSim} object to which a model has been fitted}

\item{model}{The model which has been fitted}

\item{genCoeff.function}{A function which returns a list of parameters from the model fit(s) which can 
be used when performing the gamma imputation. It takes one argument, use.uncertainty (by default is TRUE) which
if TRUE stochastically incorporates uncertainty into the parameter estimates in preparation for use with imputation 
If a Poisson/quasi-Poission model was fitted to the \code{SingleSimFit} object
then this will be NULL}

\item{equal}{dispersion whether equal dispersions were used when fitting model(s) to the data}
}
\description{
A \code{\link{summary.SingleSimFit}} method has been implemented
}
