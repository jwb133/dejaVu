\arguments{
\item{treatment.effect}{The mean of the estimated treatment.effect
from the imputed data}

\item{se}{The standard error of the (log) treatment effect calculated using Rubin's formula}

\item{df}{The number of degrees of freedom used to calculate the p-value}

\item{adjusted.df}{The number of degrees of freedom used to calculate the adjusted
p-value (this should be used if the complete data number of degrees of freedom is small)}

\item{dispersion}{The mean of the estimated dispersion parameter}

\item{pval}{The p-value for the test log(treatment.effect)=0 using Rubin's formula}

\item{adjusted.pval}{The p-value for the test log(treatment.effect)=0 using Rubin's
formula and the adjusted number of degrees of freedom}

is used to combine the test statistics into a single summary
}
