* Note about package previously having been archived in CRAN. This was due to me losing access to the old
email address. Notes about possible spelling mistakes which are not mistakes.

## Reverse dependencies

Since the package hasn't been on CRAN for a while, I presume there are no reverse dependencies. I can't run revdepcheck since it can't install dejaVu from CRAN.
